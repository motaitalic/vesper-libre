vesper-libre
============

Vesper Devanagari was began by Rob Keller in 2006, initially inspiring Vesper's Latin letterforms. The Devanagari character set was completed in 2014 through the collaboration with Kimya Gandhi. Vesper has a classical foundation, but with an entirely modern appearance, making reading comfortable, but never boring.

Vesper Libre is a special web version that has been optimized for online use. Tiny details have been simplified and the character set is reduced for the perfect balance of beautiful web typography with fast page loading.
